# vps-ops

Companion skill to `buildout`: deploy & manage the built project on the user's own VPS with
Coolify — or prove it live at $0 first on the free-preview track.

- **Two tracks, the user's choice** — *paid* (their VPS + domain) or *free preview*
  (Oracle Cloud Always Free + `.pp.ua` + Cloudflare; exit path = the migration ref).
- **Bootstrap** — SSH key, provider firewall, Coolify install, admin/token handoff, hardening, golden snapshot.
- **Ship** — repo → Coolify app + Postgres + envs + domain → first deploy → smoke.
- **Operate** — change pipeline (push → auto-deploy → wait → smoke → report), rollback, logs, metrics, backups, updates.
- **Move** — free → paid cutover with a verified integrity gate and a rollback matrix.
- Universal: pure-stdlib Python scripts; works from Hermes / Claude Code / Codex / any harness.
- The user provides a VPS + domain (Track P) or just an Oracle account (Track F); every browser
  moment is guided click-by-click.

## Install

Copy this folder into the harness's skills dir, or use the combined zip (`deckhand.zip`,
contains `buildout/` + `component-library/` + `vps-ops/`).
Known skill dirs: `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, Hermes profile skills dir.
