# Changelog - Buildout

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-19

Renamed `expert-build-pack` → **`buildout`** as part of the pack rebrand to **Deckhand** (invocation: `/buildout`). No content changes.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-09-18

- Cross-links to the `vps-ops` free-preview track (Oracle Always Free + free domain → later migration): buildout step 5 + routing row.
- Frontmatter `version` corrected (was stale at 0.2.0 while the changelog/README said 0.2.1).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-09-17

Cross-references to the new companion skill `vps-ops` (VPS deploy & management with Coolify). No functional changes.

- SKILL.md: buildout flow step 5 + routing row → `vps-ops` (bootstrap → Coolify → deploy → change pipeline → ops).
- `references/lifecycle/50-deploy.md` + `60-maintain.md`: execution pointers to `vps-ops`.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-17

Buildout engine: boilerplate start + coherent design assembly from the living shadcn registry pool + companion `component-library` skill.

- New data: `data/allowlist.json` (5 MIT-verified registries w/ evidence), `data/boilerplates.json` (open-saas, next-saas-starter, velora-ui — MIT verified 2026-09-17 via GitHub API), generated `data/registries.snapshot.json` (372 listed -> 282 kept) and `data/items/*.jsonl` catalogs (velora 64 - reui 1,773 - cult-ui 157 items).
- New scripts (stdlib Python): `scripts/registry_sync.py` (sync/check/list/onboard; includes --catalog-file offline path and a 403/429 UA fallback), `scripts/assemble_pick.py` (seeded deterministic picker; curated sections + text-match for uncurated catalogs).
- New refs: `references/buildout/00-start-from-boilerplate.md`, `10-design-assembly.md` (lock schema, anti-slop banlist, verify gates), `20-component-library.md`.
- Companion skill `component-library` v0.1.0 (store at ~/expert-build-library; index.jsonl + registry.json + r/<name>.json; add/find/list/show/copy/remove).
- Tests: 9 pack tests + 4 library tests green; picker determinism verified (identical hashes across runs); snapshot + data JSON validated.

### Notes

- cult-ui rate-limits its site (429 / Vercel checkpoint) from some IPs; onboard from the repo mirror `apps/www/public/r/registry.json` via `--catalog-file` (path recorded in the allowlist note).
- Registry Health is experimental upstream; the allowlist overrides filters for curated kits.
