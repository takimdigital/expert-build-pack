Three skill folders. Drop them into your AI coding agent and it can:

- **build** a real product from an idea — expert playbooks, execution-first loops, verified MIT boilerplates, and a coherent design assembled from a living pool of MIT component registries;
- **store** every component you build and reuse it in the next project;
- **deploy** to your own VPS — Coolify bootstrapped, domain + SSL attached, apps built and served — **or go live at $0 first** on the free-preview track (Oracle Cloud Always Free + free domain + Cloudflare);
- **operate** afterwards — change → push → deploy → smoke test → rollback, plus logs, metrics, backups and restore drills, entirely via API;
- **move** — when the business proves itself, migrate preview → paid host with a verified cutover and rollback runbook.

## ⚡ The skills

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`expert-build-pack`](skills/expert-build-pack) | **Idea → codebase.** Expert references, execution-first build loops, verified MIT boilerplates, coherent-random design assembly from the live shadcn registry pool (MIT-only), design tokens locked once and applied everywhere. |
| [`component-library`](skills/component-library) | **Build → reuse.** Save any component you build; the next project starts from what you already made. |
| [`vps-ops`](skills/vps-ops) | **Codebase → live business.** Two tracks: **paid** (your VPS + domain) or **free preview** ($0 on Oracle Cloud Always Free + a free `.pp.ua` domain). Bootstraps Coolify, wires domain/SSL, deploys with Nixpacks or Dockerfile, then runs the everyday pipeline: deploy, monitor, env changes, database + backups, rollback — plus a migration runbook to move from the free preview to a paid host. |

## 🚀 Install

No build step, no dependencies — plain `SKILL.md` folders plus stdlib Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/takimdigital/expert-build-pack.git
cd expert-build-pack
```

| Harness | Copy the skill folders into |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| Generic agents (AGENTS.md) | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| Hermes Agent | your Hermes profile `skills/` directory |

```bash
# example: Claude Code
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Then just talk to your agent:

```text
Build me an invoicing SaaS for freelancers.
Deploy it to my VPS with the domain billing.example.com.
Deploy it to the free Oracle server first — I'll pay for hosting once it makes money.
Add dark mode and ship it.
Something broke in production — check the logs and roll back.
```

The agent reads the skills, drives the whole pipeline, and reports back with real deploy and health-check evidence — not instructions for you to follow.

## ✅ Proven on a live server (not "should work")

Deployed and validated end to end against a real Coolify instance:

- [x] **Deploy** — container image app · public Git repo · private repo via deploy key
- [x] **Change pipeline** — edit → commit → push → deploy → health smoke test
- [x] **Broken deploy caught** by the smoke test → **rollback** (full-tag) → `git revert` fix-forward
- [x] **Postgres** — provisioned via API → the app executes a real query over the internal network
- [x] **Backups** — schedule → dump → **restore drill** (`pg_restore` into a scratch database, verified)
- [x] **Build packs** — Nixpacks and Dockerfile · **ops** — logs, deployments, env vars, docker cleanup
- [x] **36 unit tests** green (standard library only)
- [x] **First real business live — 2026-09-19** — CitiQuiz (Next.js + Postgres, private repo) → Contabo
  Cloud VPS 4 → Coolify 4.3.23 → **https://sidehustlepaths.com** — Cloudflare DNS-only, Let's Encrypt
  auto-renew, 2,417-question bank seeded, production owner created, dev seed credentials removed.

Every bug these drills found is fixed and pinned in the reference runbooks — they carry live-verified API shapes, not guesses.

**Two tracks, both real.** The **paid track** is proven end-to-end on a live business (the drill above);
vps-ops v0.2.2 folds in every lesson from it — the Docker-29 dashboard lock, pnpm/package-manager
pre-flight traps, Postgres recovery, and the first-run data → production-owner flow. The
**free-preview track** (vps-ops v0.2.0) takes a product live at $0 on Oracle Cloud Always Free + a free
`.pp.ua` domain behind Cloudflare, with a cutover runbook to move to a paid host later; researched and
primary-source-verified on 2026-09-18, first live run pending. Provider prices (Oracle · Contabo ·
Hostinger · Hetzner) ship in `skills/vps-ops/references/12-provider-price-sheet.md` — choosing a host
never needs fresh research.

## 🔒 Principles

- **MIT only.** Every component and registry is license-checked (SPDX) before use. No pro tier, no paywalled components, nothing proprietary bundled.
- **Living pool, never hardcoded.** The component catalog is discovered fresh from the shadcn registry index — it grows as the ecosystem grows.
- **Coherent-random design.** Design tokens (color, type, radius, motion) are locked once per project, then applied to every component — random picks that still look designed.
- **Agent-first ops.** The agent manages the server over its API: deploy, env, backups, rollback, logs. You never SSH in.
- **Token-cheap by design.** Registry metadata is compacted before the model ever sees it.
- **Execution over advice.** The skills drive work in loops with verification gates, not advice essays.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does this only work with Claude Code?**
No. The skills are plain folders with a `SKILL.md`. Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Hermes Agent — anything that reads skill folders.

**What do I need for the deploy part?**
A VPS and a domain — or nothing but an Oracle Cloud account if you start on the free-preview track. `vps-ops` bootstraps Coolify on the server and drives everything from there. Hostinger's API is baked in; any provider works over SSH.

**Will my design look AI-generated?**
That is what the Buildout Engine exists to avoid: it reuses already-excellent open-source components instead of generating slop, with tokens locked once so everything stays coherent.

**Is anything paid required?**
No. MIT-licensed components only; Coolify (Apache-2.0) runs on your own server — including the entire $0 preview stack.
